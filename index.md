in the field of [Privacy and Data Protection](https://rel-incode.github.io/cristianasantos/#privacy-and-data-protection), [Legal informatics applied to Data Protection and Consumer Law](https://rel-incode.github.io/cristianasantos/#modeling-legal-information--in-the-domains-of-data-protection-and-consumer-law), and also of [Space Law!!](https://rel-incode.github.io/cristianasantos/#space-law)



I am [Lecturer and researcher](https://www.uu.nl/staff/CTeixeiraSantos) at the School of Law, Utrecht University, working on **Law and Technology**. 

I also collaborate with [Nataliia Bielova](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Nataliia.Bielova/) and [Cédric Lauradoux](https://planete.inrialpes.fr/~lauradou/) from the [PRIVATICS Team](https://team.inria.fr/privatics/) at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en) on **legal and technical requirements for consent banners, dark patterns, and data subject rights, and I love to discover new insights from the case studies we approach which have a social impact in our daily lives!** 
Previously, I was a lawyer and worked as legal adviser and lecturer at the [Portuguese Consumer Protection Organization-DECO](https://www.deco.proteste.pt/).

### Research Profile 
The goal of my research is to make legal information structured and actionable for **legal compliance**, for models and tools. I extract legal requirements from legal sources. With this domain knowledge, I collaborate with computer scientists to both identify the technical requirements for a concrete technology, and to build ontologies. I am passionate about privacy and consumer protection and motivated to inform policy-makers on gaps between law & tech through ground work research.

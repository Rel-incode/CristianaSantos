# About me 
I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in Law and Technology in the [PRIVATICS Team](https://team.inria.fr/privatics/) at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en), working with [Nataliia Bielova](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Nataliia.Bielova/) and [Cédric Lauradoux](https://planete.inrialpes.fr/~lauradou/). Currently, I am doing research on legal and technical requirements for consent banners, dark patterns, and data subject rights, and I love it! :heart_eyes: I was a lawyer by training and worked at the [Portuguese Consumer Protection Organization-DECO](https://www.deco.proteste.pt/).

**Profile**: I am a legal researcher with interdisciplinary experience in Law&Tech. The goal of my research is to make legal information structured and actionable for legal compliance, models and tools. I extract legal requirements from legal sources and collaborate with computer scientists to identify technical requirements for a concrete technology, and to build ontologies.

**Research**
- [x] Data protection and privacy
- [x] Legal informatics, AI&Law

### Research Profile 
I am an [Assistant Professor](https://www.uu.nl/staff/CTeixeiraSantos) at the School of Law, Utrecht University. I am teaching in the Law and Technology Masters and coordenating the bachelor course on Regulating Big Tech.
I hold a PhD in Law and Technology and Informatics from the University of Luxembourg and Bologna.
Visit my current webpage [here](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/CTeixeiraSantos)

My research area is **Privacy and Data Protection**. 

My research interests include: 

* identifying legal and technical requirements for consent
* assessing purposes of personal data processing
* analysing the lawfulness of dark patterns when: users consent to web tracking, and when users access their personal data through subject access requests (SAR)
* studying usable privacy


The goal of my research is to make legal information structured and actionable for **legal compliance**, for models and tools. 
I extract legal requirements from legal sources and, with this domain knowledge, I collaborate with computer scientists and designers to identify the technical requirements for a concrete technology.  I also collaborate with Inria [PRIVATICS Team](https://team.inria.fr/privatics/).
Currently I am working on the GDPR/ePrivacy Directive **requirements for: #Consent #Purposes #SAR, and lawfulness of #Darkpatterns**.

My drive is to discover problematic practices from organizations within case-studies, and inform policy makers with ground-based analytical research to address gaps in law & tech.

Previously, I was a lawyer and worked as legal adviser and lecturer at the [Portuguese Consumer Protection Organization-DECO](https://www.deco.proteste.pt/).


### Recent News

- **Setember 2021**  Our paper **"Cookie Banners, What’s the Purpose? Analyzing Cookie Banner Text Through a Legal Lens"** was accepted at the WPES 2021. We analysed the text of banners and focused on their purposes: we found out they are described with vagueness, positive framing, bundled in multipurposes, misleading language, technical jargon... full of dark patterns within text!

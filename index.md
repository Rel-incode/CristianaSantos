I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science ([Information Security Research Group](http://sec.cs.ucl.ac.uk/home/)) at [University College London (UCL)](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/), supervised by [Prof. M. Angela Sasse](http://sec.cs.ucl.ac.uk/people/m_angela_sasse/) and [Dr. Steven Murdoch](http://sec.cs.ucl.ac.uk/users/smurdoch/). I research computer security, privacy, and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). More specifically, my research takes a user-centered approach to the design and use of secure communication tools. I study how users perceive secure communications, and what influences their decision to adopt, or not adopt, a secure tool. I am supported by a SUDS (Supporting Usability and Design in Security) Fellowship from the [Open Technology Fund (OTF)](https://www.opentech.fund/) and [Simply Secure](https://simplysecure.org), as well as a [Marie Skłodowska-Curie (MSCA-RISE) Research Fellowship](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/). My Ph.D. research is also funded by Google.

I obtained an M.Sc. (with Distinction) in Information Security from UCL in 2014. Before joining UCL, I earned a B.Sc. (1st Hons) in Computer Engineering from the [American University of Sharjah](https://www.aus.edu/) in 2013.

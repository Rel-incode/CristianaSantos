Hi! This is Cristiana. 

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in Law and Technology in the PRIVATICS Team at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en) Sophia Antipolis, working with [Nataliia Bielova](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Nataliia.Bielova/) and [CÃ©dric Lauradoux](https://planete.inrialpes.fr/~lauradou/). I am currently working on legal and technical requirements for consent of consent banners, dark patterns, and data subject rights.

**Profile:** 
I am a legal researcher with interdisciplinary experience in Law and Technology. The goal of my research is to make legal information structured and actionable for legal compliance, models and tools. I extract legal requirements from legal sources and collaborate with computer scientists to identify technical requirements for a concrete technology, and to build ontologies.

**Research Areas:**
Data protection and privacy law, consumer law. Legal informatics. AI and Law
